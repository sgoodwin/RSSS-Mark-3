Stuff that needs doing
----------------------

1. <del>Routing (we only have like 9 routes, but they should be super clear)</del>
2. Validation (each route should be easily validated to ensure proper input)
3. APIKey authentication or Basic Auth
4. Monitoring: RSSS should be able to report health and statistics.
5. i8n: Error messages and such should be localizable.
6. Might need a worker thing to clean up dead/stale accounts.
7. Test each controller (this will require making controllers more testable)
8. Test each model
