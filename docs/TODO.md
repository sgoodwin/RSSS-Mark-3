Stuff that needs doing
----------------------

1. Routing (we only have like 9 routes, but they should be super clear)
2. Validation (each route should be easily validated to ensure proper input)
3. APIKey authentication or Basic Auth
4. Tests (all this shit should be ensured to actually work)
5. Monitoring: RSSS should be able to report health and statistics.
6. i8n: Error messages and such should be localizable.
7. Might need a worker thing to clean up dead/stale accounts.
